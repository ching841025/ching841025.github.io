  Hi, I'm Amy. I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Information Systems with a focus on AI, data analytics, and product development.
  <br><br>
This portfolio highlights projects that combine technical skills with real-world applications, including stock prediction models, AI explainability tools, and chatbot systems designed with governance in mind. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to make AI more useful, transparent, and human-centered.

Thank you for visiting.
