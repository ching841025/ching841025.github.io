This project showcases my skills and knowledge in building a stock selection machine learning pipeline. Using Python, scikit-learn, and various data processing libraries, I designed and implemented an end-to-end system that includes data extraction from the Alpaca API, feature engineering with financial indicators, clustering analysis, and model evaluation. This work demonstrates my ability to integrate data analytics and machine learning to support investment decision-making.
